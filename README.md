# Applied Mathematics problems and solutions

This repository is a collection of solutions of general applied mathematics problems.

Most of the problems are either stated, when they are not widely known, or not, in the converse case.

Solution to all the problems are in one (or more) of the above languages.


## Mathematica

Files terminated by .nb. Run them from within Mathematica, avoid Mathematica's "math" shell.

## R

Files terminated by .R or .r. Run them from within RStudio or in R shell

```
> R < file.R
```

## Matlab

Files terminated by .m, not to be confused by Maple's command line source files. Run from within Matlab.

## Ruby

Files terminated by .rb. Run them by typing

```
> ruby file.rb
```

## Python

Files terminated by .py

Run them by typing

```
> python file.py
```

## Maxima

Files terminated by .wxm. There is a nice interface to the usual, command-line Maxima called WxMaxima, which can handle .wxm files.


## C/C++

Least but not last, a few experiments are coded in C or C++. 

They are coded in ANSI C, which should run on any modern C compiler, or C++, and should run at least in any Linux distribution shipped with a C++ compiler, usually g++. In some cases, you can also use a shipped Makefile to ease the compiling-linking treadmill.
