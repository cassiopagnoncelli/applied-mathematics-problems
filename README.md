# Applied Mathematics problems and solutions

This repository is a collection of solutions of general applied mathematics problems.

Most of the problems are either stated, when they are not widely known, or not, in the converse case.

Solution to all the problems are in one (or more) of the above languages.

## Mathematica

Files terminated by .nb. Run them from within Mathematica, avoid Mathematica's "math" shell.

## R

!(R)[http://s30.postimg.org/6hj9aj2kx/Rlogo_1.png]

Files terminated by .R or .r. Run them from within RStudio or in R shell

```
> R < file.R
```

## Ruby

Files terminated by .rb. Run them by typing

```
> ruby file.rb
```

## Python

!(Python)[http://s12.postimg.org/p1286xth9/260px_Python_logo_and_wordmark_svg.png]

Files terminated by .py

Run them by typing

```
> python file.py
```

## Maple

Files terminated by .mw. Some of them must be run from within Maple (.mw), others (.m) are mandatory to run from its shell (command-line mode).

## Matlab

!(Matlab)[http://s14.postimg.org/5roiy3lpd/Matlab.jpg]

Files terminated by .m, not to be confused by Maple's command line source files. Run from within Matlab.

## Maxima

Files terminated by .wxm. There is a nice interface to the usual, command-line Maxima called WxMaxima, which can handle .wxm files.
